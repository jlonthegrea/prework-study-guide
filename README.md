# <SUCCESSFUL PREWORK!>

## Description

The motovation behind building this web application was to organize and view my prework notes that includes all the topics that were discussed in all modules. Topics that include HTML, JavaScript, Git, and JavaScript which are base sectors for learning to code. This was a better place to store notes than on a sheet of paper or in a word document. I also wanted to be able to navigate directly to specific notes when it comes time to review the material written. Creating the web application avoids any future forgotten infornmation as it is readily on hand to review. I have learned a chunk of infornmation pertainig the four topics that the Prework went over that I also listed in the notes portion under each topic.
